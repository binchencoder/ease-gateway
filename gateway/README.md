# grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway

grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway: grpc-gateway is a plugin of protoc. It reads
gRPC service definition, and generates a reverse-proxy server which translates
a RESTful JSON API into gRPC. This server is generated according to custom
options in your gRPC definition.

Hosted on https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway.
